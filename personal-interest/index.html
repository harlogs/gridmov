The season is produced by Kilter Films, Bad Robot, and Warner Bros. Television, with Jonathan Nolan, Greg Plageman, J. J. Abrams, and Bryan Burk serving as executive producers and Plageman serving as showrunner.
The series was renewed for a second season in March 2012[1] and stars Jim Caviezel, Taraji P. Henson, Kevin Chapman and Michael Emerson. The series revolves around a mysterious reclusive billionaire computer programmer, Harold Finch, who has developed a computer program for the federal government known as "the Machine" that is capable of collating all sources of information to predict terrorist acts and to identify people planning them. The Machine also identifies perpetrators and victims of other premeditated deadly crimes; however, because the government considers these "irrelevant", Finch programs the Machine to delete this information each night and programs the Machine to notify him secretly of the "irrelevant" numbers. Finch recruits John Reese, a former Green Beret and CIA agent, now presumed dead – to investigate the people identified by the numbers the Machine has provided, and to act accordingly.'><meta property="og:image" content="https://movies.technologymanias.com/images/personal-interest-1746336941324.jpg"><meta property="og:url" content="https://movies.technologymanias.com/personal-interest/"><meta property="og:type" content="article"></head><body class="bg-black text-white min-h-screen flex flex-col"><header class="bg-gray-900 p-4"><div class="flex flex-wrap items-start justify-center sm:justify-start"><a href=/ class="w-full sm:w-auto text-center sm:text-left mb-4 sm:mb-0"><img src=https://movies.technologymanias.com/images/logo.png alt="Movies Manias" class="h-24 sm:h-[14.25rem] w-auto max-w-full transition-all duration-500"></a><div class="flex flex-col flex-1 w-full sm:w-auto mt-4 sm:mt-0"><nav class="text-white mb-4 overflow-x-auto"><ul class="flex flex-wrap gap-4 font-semibold"><li><a href=/ class="bg-black text-red-500 rounded-lg px-4 py-2 hover:bg-red-500 hover:text-white transition-all whitespace-nowrap">Home</a></li><li class="relative group"><a href=# class="bg-black text-red-500 rounded-lg px-4 py-2 hover:bg-red-500 hover:text-white transition-all whitespace-nowrap">Categories</a><ul class="absolute left-0 hidden group-hover:flex flex-col bg-gray-900 text-white mt-2 p-2 rounded shadow-lg z-50 min-w-[10rem]"><li><a href=/categories/action class="block bg-black text-red-500 rounded-lg px-4 py-2 hover:bg-red-500 hover:text-white transition-all">Action</a></li><li><a href=/categories/adventure class="block bg-black text-red-500 rounded-lg px-4 py-2 hover:bg-red-500 hover:text-white transition-all">Adventure</a></li><li><a href=/categories/comedy class="block bg-black text-red-500 rounded-lg px-4 py-2 hover:bg-red-500 hover:text-white transition-all">Comedy</a></li><li><a href=/categories/crime class="block bg-black text-red-500 rounded-lg px-4 py-2 hover:bg-red-500 hover:text-white transition-all">Crime</a></li><li><a href=/categories/drama class="block bg-black text-red-500 rounded-lg px-4 py-2 hover:bg-red-500 hover:text-white transition-all">Drama</a></li><li><a href=/categories/family class="block bg-black text-red-500 rounded-lg px-4 py-2 hover:bg-red-500 hover:text-white transition-all">Family</a></li><li><a href=/categories/fantasy class="block bg-black text-red-500 rounded-lg px-4 py-2 hover:bg-red-500 hover:text-white transition-all">Fantasy</a></li><li><a href=/categories/horror class="block bg-black text-red-500 rounded-lg px-4 py-2 hover:bg-red-500 hover:text-white transition-all">Horror</a></li><li><a href=/categories/mystery class="block bg-black text-red-500 rounded-lg px-4 py-2 hover:bg-red-500 hover:text-white transition-all">Mystery</a></li><li><a href=/categories/romance class="block bg-black text-red-500 rounded-lg px-4 py-2 hover:bg-red-500 hover:text-white transition-all">Romance</a></li><li><a href=/categories/science-fiction class="block bg-black text-red-500 rounded-lg px-4 py-2 hover:bg-red-500 hover:text-white transition-all">Science Fiction</a></li><li><a href=/categories/thriller class="block bg-black text-red-500 rounded-lg px-4 py-2 hover:bg-red-500 hover:text-white transition-all">Thriller</a></li><li><a href=/categories/war class="block bg-black text-red-500 rounded-lg px-4 py-2 hover:bg-red-500 hover:text-white transition-all">War</a></li></ul></li><li><a href=https://www.technologymanias.com class="bg-black text-red-500 rounded-lg px-4 py-2 hover:bg-red-500 hover:text-white transition-all whitespace-nowrap">Technology Manias</a></li><li><a href=https://games.technologymanias.com class="bg-black text-red-500 rounded-lg px-4 py-2 hover:bg-red-500 hover:text-white transition-all whitespace-nowrap">Games Manias</a></li><li><a href=/terms class="bg-black text-red-500 rounded-lg px-4 py-2 hover:bg-red-500 hover:text-white transition-all whitespace-nowrap">Terms & Conditions</a></li><li><a href=/contact class="bg-black text-red-500 rounded-lg px-4 py-2 hover:bg-red-500 hover:text-white transition-all whitespace-nowrap">Contact Us</a></li></ul></nav></div></div></header><div class="flex flex-col lg:flex-row flex-1 w-full"><main class="w-full lg:w-3/4 p-4"><div class="flex flex-col lg:flex-row w-full gap-4"><div class="w-full lg:w-[300px] lg:h-[350px] shrink-0"><img src=https://movies.technologymanias.com/images/personal-interest-1746336941324.jpg alt="Personal Interest" class="w-full h-full object-cover rounded shadow"></div><div class="flex-1 text-white space-y-4 relative"><div class="flex justify-between items-center"><h1 class="bg-red-700 text-3xl px-2 py-1 font-bold">Personal Interest</h1></div><p><strong>Added on:</strong> <span class="bg-yellow-700 px-2 py-1 rounded-full mr-2">May 4, 2025</span></p><p><strong>Language:</strong>

Carter vows vengeance against HR after they have her boyfriend, Detective Cal Beecher, murdered. Reese and Finch encounter Sameen Shaw, a U.S. Army ISA assassin, on the run after being betrayed by her employers. Shaw learns about the Machine in the season two finale and subsequently becomes a member of Reese and Finch's team.
